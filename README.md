# Sakila DVD Rental Database
by Oreva Egwebe


## Introduction

The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.


## Key Insights

- What was the total rental orders processed by the different stores?

- What was the total amount paid by the top 10 customers?

- What was the most liked category of Family-friendly movies?

- What were the quartiles of rental duration in the Family-friendly categories?
